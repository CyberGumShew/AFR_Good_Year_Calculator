This calculator is used by Air Force Reserve members to calculate whether their schedule/planned service dates will provide a "good year".
Its a simple excel macro that adds the points together. 

Instructions: 
Step 1: Input your R/R date & the current FY period. (The macro will take the Day and Month of this date and find your NEXT R/R date for the calculations)
Step 2: Input your planned IDT dates & number of drill periods per day over the timeframe. (If the drills/day changes over the timeframe, input each into a new row)
Step 3: Input your planned AT dates. "Days in Period" is automatically calculated by the spreadsheet, but double check that it is correct.
Step 4: Click calculate.
Step 5: The macro calculates the number of points (including 15 membership points) in the your current R/R year and any for the next R/R year. It also calculates how many AT days and IDT drills in the current FY period, so that you know if you are below/above the authorized number.
